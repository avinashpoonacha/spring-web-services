# spring-web-services

This is my implementation and understanding of Spring webservices and Spring Cloud . 

1. created helloWorld controller with GET and POST mappings 
2. created User controller for basic function of access and retrieval to be later replaced by JPA.
3. created custom 201 response entity . 
4. created custom exception handler with ResponseEntityExceptionHandler override
5. added validation libs
